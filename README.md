# Cable_Driven_Upperbody_Exosuit\
## Repository Introduction
This project implements the Bowden cable interface to design a 6-DOF bilaterial upper limb exosuit which integrates load cell, IMU and EMG sensor. To leverage the exosuit's architecture, human-intention based control is needed. 

This repository includes our working while developing the myoelectric cotnrol system for the CUBE exosuit
